 · Attach to the container using the container’s ID or name: docker container attach my_nginx. Copy. The default command of the nginx image which is executed when you run the container is set to CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"].

A Metasploit module “gitlab_file_read_rce” was available to open a reverse connect back shell on the target box: The “docker-security” binary executes “chmod” file without specifying its full path so it was possible to arbitrarily run a bash shell on behalf of the root user.  · We tried to login to docker user using default credentials and were successful! ifconfig python3 -c 'import pty; ("/bin/bash")' ssh [email protected] tcuser. Furthermore, upon inspecting sudoers file, we see that docker could run any command as root and so we compromise the root user of this boot2docker VM using the command. sudo -i.
