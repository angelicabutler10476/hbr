 · When you recover your Macbook, it is like a reset for part of your computer, in this case the operating system "OS X" (Apple's operating system). I say partly reset because your password information usually stays the same within the hard drive and can "hook on" to the new settings when you try to connect to the WiFi, and thus not connect.  · · The issue is likely related to corrupt network preference files from the previous version of Mac OS you upgraded from. Follow the steps below to reset your network settings. Note: Removing and re-adding the network connection in network preferences does not work. On your Mac, select from the Finder Menu Go -> Go To Folder 4/5(20). I'm trying to set up Ethernet through the RTL kext in my CLOVER folder but it won't work, so I can't start the Catalina installer which requires an internet connection. Here's my Ethernet card being recognised in kali. I don't have SSDTs or DSTDs, except , so I can actually boot. I'm a hackintosh rookie, so any tips are appreciated.
