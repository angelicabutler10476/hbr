Quickstart. The quickest way to get conneceted is to simply download le from the Accesssection, open your terminal within the download directory and connect with the command: openvpn  Make sure you substitute yourusernamefor the name of le which by default uses your HTB username. You're not able to connect to our internal OpenVPN network. Solution: Ensure you have a stable working network connection and that  file's keys are not revoked.

If there's a firewall on your network, whitelist our VPN services.  · Now to add the the OpenVPN connection to your list of linux networks: sudo nmcli connection import type openvpn file Downloads/ Verify the new network connection was added: sudo nmcli connection.
