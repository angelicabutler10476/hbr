 · Hi Friends,Today we are going to see how to connect to the Hack The Box VPN1. Goto Access page2. Download ovpn file3. run below command to connect the VPN su. You’ll need to navigate to the left-hand side menu and click on Labs, then Machines from your dashboard. This will take you to the Boxes line-up page, where you can find all controls required for you to play the Boxes. This includes VPN connection details and controls, Active and Retired Boxes, a to-do list, and more. Machine difficulties. ping [machine's IP adress] --> Result: connection works. ssh username@ip --> Nothing happenes; after 30 secons: target pinged out or target refused connection (both on port 22) I started the pwnbox (on browser). It started, then I tried to ssh to that machine from there. It worked. Then I tried from my PC. It worked too.
