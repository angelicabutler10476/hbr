[[Release] Danganronpa English Translation v] Big Congratz to Project Zetsubou who has been busy with this release since August Note that this patch only works on the PSP The Best edition of the game. Acquire the game (see below) and follow the tutorial on applying the patch on their blog post.

Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei is a visual novel game for the Sony Playstation Portable. The game was released in Japan : Visual Novel.
