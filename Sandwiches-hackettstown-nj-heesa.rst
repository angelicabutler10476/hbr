Hanoi Burger $ Hackettstown, NJ Claim this business. Location: Main Street, Hackettstown, , NJ. Hackettstown, NJ. Save The sandwiches were great but the real star was the mozz - I could eat it plain or as a caprese salad any day. The mozz was still warm, so if you take leftovers home it will harden up a little in the fridge and won't be the same as eating it right then and there. They also have some imported Italian groceries/snacks.
