New Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth based soundtrack for Doom 1, ported by Sakitoshi Fixed a backpack ammo save/load bug SVN Fixed GBA Micro compatibility issues. SVN Fixed the ammo counter flickering when changing weapons, which got broken from my previous fix. SVN Merged all changes from doomhack’s new optimised ry: Improvement.  · Since its more of a ROM Hack than a mod or WAD, I'm posting it here. I have finished (apart from the flats) my first Doom II GBA Rom Hack called, Doom II Paint Edition! Concept: Simple. Replaced every texture in the game with a low-definition Paint-made version. Classic video game modifications, fan translations, homebrew, utilities, and learning resources.
